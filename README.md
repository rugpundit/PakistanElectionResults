# PakistanElectionResults
A database of Pakistan Elections from 1970 to 2018

The database includes results for candidates for National and 4 Provincial Assemblies of Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly North-West Frontier Province or NWFP) and Baluchistan. It covers both General Election and By-Election. 

I have tried my best to clean the data before release. However, I believe there might be some missing votes information for less than 100 results/rows. 
If you happen to update the files with the missing data/errors, please share with me so it can be updated here too. 

I wanted to work on it a bit more and release it in a better shape but I am unable to find time for it so it's better that others make use of it on their own. Here is what I wanted to do: 
1. Translate to Urdu
2. Connect Candidates & Parties (to study voting patterns and gauge votebank of candidate vs party; I found a lot of discrepency in candidates names so that will require some manual work)

For any further information or feedback, please write me at yasirhsheikh@gmail.com or @rugpundit on Twitter. You can also join the community I have found for this specific purpose: https://twitter.com/i/communities/1519647935155294208

# PakistanElectionResults
A database of Pakistan Elections from 1970 to 2018

The database includes results for candidates for National and 4 Provincial Assemblies of Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly North-West Frontier Province or NWFP) and Baluchistan. It covers both General Election and By-Election. 

I have tried my best to clean the data before release. However, I believe there might be some missing votes information for less than 100 results/rows. 
If you happen to update the files with the missing data/errors, please share with me so it can be updated here too. 

For any further information or feedback, please write me at yasirhsheikh@gmail.com or @rugpundit on Twitter.
